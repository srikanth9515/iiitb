\item
RHS:	For two right angled triangles, if the hypotenuse and one of the sides are equal, show that the triangles are congruent.
\\
\solution In $\triangle$s $IDB$ and $IFB$ in  Fig. \ref{fig:tri_icentre},  $ID\perp BC, IF\perp AB, IB$ is a common side and $ID = IF$, i.e. both triangles are right angled, have the same hypotenuse and one equal leg.  This information was sufficient to show that $BD = BF$.  Similarly, it can be shown that all angles of both triangles are equal.  Such triangles are known as {\em congruent} triangles and denoted by $\triangle IDB \cong \triangle IEB$.
\item Show that $IA, IB, IC$ bisect the angles $A, B$ and $C$ respectively.  
\item Angle bisectors of $\triangle ABC$ meet at the incentre $\vec{I}$.

\item
To show that two triangles are congruent, it is sufficient to show that some corresponding angles and sides are equal.  Sine and cosine formulae are sufficient to show that two triangles are congruent.



\item
SSS:	Show that if the corresponding sides of three triangles are equal, the triangles are congruent.

\item
ASA:	Show that if two angles and any one side  are equal in corresponding triangles, the triangles are congruent.

\item
SAS:	Show that if two sides and the angle between them are equal in corresponding triangles, the triangles are congruent.%
