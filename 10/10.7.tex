\begin{enumerate}
\item Do the points $(3,2), (-2,-3)$ and $(2,3)$ form a triangle? If so, name the type of triangle formed.
\item Show that the points $(1,7),(4,2),(-1,-1)$ and $(-4,4)$ are the vertices of a square.
\item \figref{fig:7.6} shows the arrangement of desks in a classroom. Ashima, Bharti and Camella are seated at $A(3,1),B(6,4)$ and $C(8,6)$ respectively. Do you think they are seated in a line? Give reasons for your answer.
