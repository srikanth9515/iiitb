\begin{enumerate}
\item Check whether the following are quadratic equations:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item $(x+1)^2=2(x-3)$
\item $x^2-2x=(-2)(3-x)$
\item $(x-2)(x+1)=(x-1)(x+3)$
\item $(x-3)(2x-1)=x(x+5)$
\item $(2x-1)(x-3)=(x+5)(x-1)$
\item $x^2+3x+1=(x-2)^2$
\item $(x+2)^3=2x(x^2-1)$
\item $x^3-4x^2-x-1=(x-2)^3$
\end{enumerate}
\item Represent the folloing situations in form of quadratic equations:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item The area of rectangulr plot is $528m^2$. The length of the plot (in metres) is one more than twice its breadth. We need to find the length and breadth of the plot.
\item The product of two consecutive positive integers is $306$. We need to find the integers.
\item Rohan's mother is $26$ years older than him. The product of their ages(in years) $3$ years from now will be $360$. We would like to find Rohan's present age.
\item A train travels a distance of $480km$ at a unifom speed. If the speed had been $8km/h$ less, then it would have taken $3 hours$ more to cover the same distance. We need to find the speed of the train.
\end{enumerate}
