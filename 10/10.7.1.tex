\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the distance between the following pairs of points:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item $(2,3), (4,1)$
\item $(-5,7), (-1,3)$
\item $(a,b), (-a,b)$
\end{enumerate}
\item Find the distance between the points $(0,0)$ and $(36,15)$. Can you now find the two town A and B discussed in section $7.2$.
\item Determine if the points $(1,5), (2,3)$ and $(-2,11)$ are collinear.
\item Check whether $(5,2), (6,4)$ and $(7,2)$ are the vertices of an isoceles triangle.
\item In a classroom, $4$ friends are seated at the points $A, B, C$ and $D$ as shown \figref{fig:7.8} in  Champa and chameli walk into the class and  after observing for a fwe minutes champa asks chameli, \textquotedblleft Don't you think ABCD is a square?\textquotedblright  Chameli disagrees Using distance formula, find which of them is correct.

\item Name the type of quadrilateral formed, if any, by the following points, and give reasons for your answer:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item $(-1,2), (1,0), (-1,2), (3,0)$
\item $(-3,5), (3,1), (0,3), (-1,-4)$
\item $(4,5), (7,6), (4,3), (1,2)$
\end{enumerate}
\item Find the point on the $x$ axis which is equidistant from $(2,5)$ and $(2,9)$. 
\item Find the values of $y$ for which the distance between the points $P(2,-3)$ and $Q(10,y)$ is $10$ units.
\item $Q(0,1)$ is equidistant from $P(5,-3)$ and $R(x,6)$,find the values of $x$. Also find the distances $QR$ and $PR$.
\item Find a relation  between $x$ and $y$ such that $(x,y)$ is equidistant from the point $(3,6)$ and $(-3,4)$.
