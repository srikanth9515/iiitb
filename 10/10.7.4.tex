\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the ratio in which the line $2x+y-4=0$ divides the line segment joining the points $A(2,-2)$  and $B(3,7)$.
\item Find a relation between $x$ and $y$ if the points $(x,y), (1,2)$ and $(7,0)$ are collinear.
\item Find the centre of a circle passing through the points $(6,-6), (3,-7)$ and $(3,3)$.
\item The two opposite vertices of a square are $(-1,2)$ and $(3,2)$. Find the coordinates of the two other vertices.
\item The Class X students of a secondary school in Krishinagar have been allotted a rectangular plot of land for their gardening activity. Sapling of Gulmohar are planted on the boundary at a distance of 1m from each other. there is a triangular grassy lawn in the plot as shown in \figref{fig:7.14}. The students are to sow seeds of flowering plants on the remaining area of the plot.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item Taking $A$ as origin, find the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.
\item What will be tthe coordinates of the vertices of $\triangle PQR$ if $C$ is the origin Also calculate the areas of the triangles in these cases. What do you observe?

\item The vertices of a $\triangle ABC$ are $A(4,6), B(1,5)$ and $C(7,2)$. A line is drawn to intersect sides $AB$ and $AC$ at $D$ and $E$ respectively, such that $\frac {AD}{AB}=\frac{AE}{AC}=\frac{1}{4}$. Calculate the area of the $\triangle AD$ and compare it with he area of $\triangle ABC$.
\item Let $A(4,2), B(6,5)$ and $C(1,4)$ be the vertices of $\triangle ABC$.
