\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the area of the triangles whose vertices are:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item $(2,3), (-1,0), (2,-4)$
\item $(-5,1), (3,-5), (5,2)$
\end{enumerate}
\item In each of the following value of 'K', for which the 
points are collinear.
\item Find the area of the triangle by joining the mid-points of the sides of the triangle whose vertices are $(0,1), (2,1)$ and $(0,3)$. Find the ratio of this area to the area of the given triangle.
\item Find the area of the quadrilateral whose vertices, taken in order, are $(-4,-2), (-3,-5), (3,-2)$ and $(2,3)$. 
\item You have studied in class IX (chapter 9, Example 3),that a median of a triangle divides in two triangles of equal areas. Verify this result for $\triangle ABC$ whose vertices are $A(4,-6), B(3,-2)$ and $C(5,2)$.
\end{enumerate}
