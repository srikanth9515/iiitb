\item Solve the following pair of equations by reducing them to a pair of linear equations:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2x}+\frac{1}{3y}=2 \\ \frac{1}{3x}+\frac{1}{2y}=\frac{13}{6}
\end{align}
\item
\begin{align}
\frac{2}{\sqrt{x}}+\frac{3}{\sqrt{y}}=2\\
\frac{4}{\sqrt{x}}-\frac{9}{\sqrt{y}}=-1
\end{align}
\item
\begin{align}
\frac{4}{x}+3y=14\\ \frac{3}{x}-4y=23
\end{align}
\item
\begin{align}
\frac{5}{x-1}+\frac{1}{y-2}=2\\ \frac{6}{x-1}-\frac{3}{y-2}=1
\end{align}
\item
\begin{align}
\frac{7x-2y}{xy}=5\\ \frac{8x+7y}{xy}=15
\end{align}
\item
\begin{align}
6x+3y=6xy\\ 2x+4y=5xy
\end{align}
\item
\begin{align}
\frac{10}{x+y}+\frac{2}{x-y}=4\\ \frac{15}{x+y}-\frac{5}{x-y}=-2
\end{align}
\item
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{3x+y}+\frac{1}{3x-y}=\frac{3}{4}\\ \frac{1}{2(3x+y)}-\frac{1}{2(3x-y)}=\frac{-1}{8}
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
\item Formulate the following problems as a pair of equations,and hence find their solutions:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item Ritu can row downstream $20km$ in $2$ hours, and upstream $4km$ in $2$ hours. Find her speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current.
\item $2$ women and $5$ men can together finish an embroidery work in $4$ days, while $3$ women and $6$ men can finish it in $3$ days. Find the time taken by $1$ women along to finish the work, and also that taken by $1$ men alone.
\item Roohi travels $300 km$ to her home partly by train and partly by bus. She takes $4$ hours if she travels $60km$ by train and the remaining by bus. If she travels $100km$ by train and the remaining by bus, she takes $10$ minutes longer. Find the speed of the train and the bus seperately.
