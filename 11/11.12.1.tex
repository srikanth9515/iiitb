\begin{enumerate}
\item $A$ points is on the axis. What are its $y$ coordinate and $z$ coordinates?
\item $A$ point  in the $XZ$-plane. What can you say about its $y$ coordinates?
\item Name the octants in which the  following points  lie:
\begin{align}
(1,2,3), (4,-2,3), (4,-2,-5), (4,2,-5), (-4,2,-5), (-4,2,-5), (-3,-1,6), (-2,-4,-7)
\end{align}
\item Fill in the blanks:- 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item The $x$ axis and $y$ axis taken together determine a plane known as \rule{1cm}{0.15mm} .
\item The coordinates of points in the $XY$. plane are of the form \rule{1cm}{0.15mm}.
\item Coordinate plane divide the space into  \rule{1cm}{0.15mm} octants.
\end{enumerate}
